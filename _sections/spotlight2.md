This is also a <strong>Spotlight</strong> element, and it's here because this demo would look a bit empty with just one spotlight. Like all spotlights, you can customize its appearance with a number of modifiers, as well as assign it an optional <code>onload</code> or <code>onscroll</code> transition modifier.
