This is a <strong>Spotlight</strong> element, and it's generally used &ndash; as its name implies &ndash; to spotlight a particular feature, subject, or pretty much whatever. You can customize its appearance with a number of modifiers, as well as assign it an optional <code>onload</code> or <code>onscroll</code> transition modifier.
