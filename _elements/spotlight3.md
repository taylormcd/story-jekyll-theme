## Spotlight

And yes, this is another <strong>Spotlight</strong> element, and it's also here because I need to fill a bit of space. Naturally, like any other spotlight, you can customize its appearance with a number of modifiers, as well as assign it an optional <code>onload</code> or <code>onscroll</code> transition modifier.
